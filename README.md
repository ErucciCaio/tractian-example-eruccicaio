Project made using the following packages:

  - flutter;
  - mobx;
  - flutter_svg;
  - flutter_modular;
  - mobx_codegen;
  - http;

Possible improvements:

  - Changes to the API, to enable loading chunks of data, instead of the entire tree: Loading the entire dataset caused the app to slow down when loading data and sorting through the tree;
  - More filters, making it possible to filter out only vibration sensors, for example;
  - Ordering filters, making it possible to sort by name, number of locations/assets in the tree, and status;
  - Collapsable trees, making it better to sort through and view items in the tree;
